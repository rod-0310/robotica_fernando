[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrecursos.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "recursos",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "recursos" with any
  of the following names:

    recursosConfig.cmake
    recursos-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "recursos" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "recursos_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "recursos" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
